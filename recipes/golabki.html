        <h4>Ingridients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li> head cabbage, cored</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>½ pound ground pork</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups cooked rice</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>3 (10.5 ounce) cans condensed tomato soup</li>
            <li>2 (12 fluid ounce) cans tomato juice, or more to taste</li>
            <li>½ cup ketchup</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Place cabbage head into the pot, cover, and cook until leaves are softened enough to remove from the head, about 3 minutes. Remove cabbage from the pot and let sit until leaves are cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove 18 whole leaves from the cabbage head, cutting out any thick tough center ribs. Set whole leaves aside. Chop the remaining cabbage and spread it in the bottom of a casserole dish.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and sauté until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Combine beef, pork, cooked rice, garlic, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Add onion and mix until well combined.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place about 1/2 cup beef mixture onto a cabbage leaf. Roll the leaf around beef mixture, tucking in the sides to create an envelope around the meat. Repeat to make remaining cabbage rolls. Place cabbage rolls in a layer over chopped cabbage in the casserole dish. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Whisk condensed soup, tomato juice, and ketchup together in a bowl; pour over cabbage rolls and cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cabbage is tender and meat is cooked through, about 1 hour. Uncover for the last 20 to 30 minutes of cooking. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
